## Commit Message

When writing a commit message, follow the [seven rules of a great commit message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/):

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line.
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
3. Capitalize the subject line.
4. Do not end the subject line with a period.
5. Use the imperative mood, as used in a command or request, in the subject line.
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters.
7. Use the body to explain what and why versus how.
