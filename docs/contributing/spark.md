# Spark

The Spark related modules share the same setup, build and code style as the [Java SDK](./java.md). 

## Setup

In addition to Java, Spark integration also requires Scala 2.12 or 2.13.

## Versioning

Spark modules are isolated based on the Spark version with folder structure `spark/<version>/<module-name>`.
Currently only Spark 3.5 is supported, with all modules under `spark/3.5`.
